# robo_ball_game
Old Unity Game I made while teaching a STEM summer camp for Middle Schoolers. One of my first full original games.

Unity Version 4 (circa summer 2014 for Dev on this ... be kind with judgements lol.)

Certain Asset Files will need to be Unziped to work.
Asset files are all that are provided as the project and settings files are no longer compatible with current Unity Versions. 

You can use the PlayRoboBall folder to find what you need to play the game locally on a Windows machine.
